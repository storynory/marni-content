A sunny little loaf cake with soft pieces of mango and a sharp lime drizzle.
The coconut gives the crumb a bit of texture without being too heavy.

1. Heat the oven to 170°C (fan). Line a 900 g loaf tin.
2. Beat the butter and sugar together until pale.
3. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Fold in the flour, coconut and lime zest.
4. Gently fold through the chopped mango.
5. Spoon into the tin, level the top and bake for 40–45 minutes, until a skewer comes out clean.
6. Mix the lime juice with the icing sugar to make a thin drizzle.
7. While the cake is still warm, poke a few holes with a skewer and spoon the drizzle over.
8. Leave to cool completely in the tin.
