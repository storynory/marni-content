A sort of lighter moussaka-style bake with spiced lentils and soft slices of aubergine.
You can keep it vegan by skipping the cheese, or add a layer of feta on top.

1. Heat the oven to 190°C (fan). Brush the aubergine slices with a little olive oil, season and roast on a tray for 20 minutes, turning once.
2. Meanwhile, warm the remaining oil in a pan and cook the onion until soft. Add the garlic and spices and cook for 1 minute.
3. Stir in the lentils, tomatoes and stock. Simmer for 10–15 minutes until thickened. Season well.
4. Spoon half the lentil mixture into a small baking dish, layer over half the aubergine, then repeat.
5. Scatter with cheese, if using.
6. Bake for 20 minutes, until bubbling and golden at the edges.
