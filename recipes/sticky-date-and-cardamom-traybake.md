A soft, sticky traybake with plenty of dates and a whisper of cardamom. Cut into
squares and keep in a tin for after-school snacks or easy puds.

1. Heat the oven to 170°C (fan). Line a 20 x 20 cm tin.
2. Put the chopped dates in a bowl, pour over the hot water and stir in the bicarbonate of soda. Leave for 10 minutes.
3. Whisk in the sugar, melted butter and eggs.
4. Fold in the flour, cardamom and salt until just combined.
5. Pour into the tin and smooth the top.
6. Bake for 25–30 minutes, until risen and just firm to the touch.
7. While still warm, drizzle the top with honey or date syrup. Cool before slicing.
