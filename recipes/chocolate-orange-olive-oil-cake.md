A deeply chocolatey cake with a gentle hint of orange and the soft crumb you get from baking with olive oil. It feels a little bit special but is easy enough for a weekday pudding.

This one is lovely served just warm with a spoon of yoghurt or crème fraîche, and it keeps well for a couple of days in a tin.
