A gently spiced, comforting stew that feels a bit like holiday food but uses
simple cupboard ingredients. Lovely with couscous, rice or warm flatbreads.

1. Warm the olive oil in a wide pan and cook the onion with a pinch of salt until soft.
2. Stir in the garlic, cumin, coriander, cinnamon and chilli flakes and cook for 1 minute.
3. Add the tomato purée and cook it off for another minute.
4. Tip in the tomatoes, chickpeas and apricots. Crumble in the saffron and pour in the stock.
5. Simmer gently for 20–25 minutes, until the sauce has thickened slightly and the apricots are soft.
6. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Scatter with fresh coriander just before serving.
