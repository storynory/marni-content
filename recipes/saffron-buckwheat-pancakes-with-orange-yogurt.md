  - 100 g buckwheat flour
  - 50 g plain flour"
  - 1 tsp baking powder
  - ¼ tsp fine sea salt
  - A pinch of saffron threads
instructions:
  - Warm 2 tbsp of the milk until just hot, then add the saffron threads and leave to infuse for 5–10 minutes.
  - n a bowl, whisk together the buckwheat flour, plain flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.
  - n a jug, mix the remaining milk, the saffron milk, egg, melted butter or oil, and orange zest
  - Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and whisk until just combined. A few small lumps are fine. Rest the batter for 10 minutes.
methodNotes: |-
  ```plain
    Buckwheat can make the batter a little thicker than normal pancake
    mix. If it looks stodgy, loosen it with a splash more milk until it
    drops from a spoon in a thick ribbon. Resting the batter helps the
    flours hydrate and gives you a softer, more tender pancake.
