Banana bread with a little twist: white miso brings a gentle saltiness and
depth of flavour, and sesame seeds give the crust a bit of crunch.

It is good still slightly warm with butter, and even better the next day.

1. Heat the oven to 170°C (fan). Line a small loaf tin (about 1 lb/450 g).
2. Mash the bananas in a large bowl. Whisk in the sugar, miso, melted butter and egg.
3. Sift in the flour, baking powder and bicarbonate of soda. Fold until just combined.
4. Pour the batter into the tin and sprinkle the top with sesame seeds.
5. Bake for 45–50 minutes, or until a skewer comes out clean.
6. Cool in the tin for 15 minutes, then move to a wire rack.
