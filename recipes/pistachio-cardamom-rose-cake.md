A light, fragrant cake inspired by Middle Eastern flavours. Cardamom and rose
can be strong, so this version keeps them gentle and friendly.

Bake it in a loaf tin for easy slicing alongside tea or coffee.

1. Heat the oven to 170°C (fan). Grease and line a 900 g loaf tin.
2. Beat the butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy.
3. Beat in the eggs one at a time, adding a spoonful of flour if it looks curdled.
4. Fold in the remaining flour, ground pistachios and ground cardamom.
5. Stir through the milk and rosewater to make a soft batter.
6. Spoon into the tin, level the top and bake for 35–40 minutes, until risen and springy.
7. Warm the honey gently and brush over the hot cake. Scatter with chopped pistachios.
8. Leave to cool in the tin before slicing.
