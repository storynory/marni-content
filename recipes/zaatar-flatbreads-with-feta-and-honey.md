Soft little pan-cooked flatbreads brushed with za'atar and topped with salty feta
and a drizzle of honey. They make a very good nibble with drinks, or a light lunch
with salad.

1. Put the flour, yeast, salt and sugar in a bowl and mix. Stir in the olive oil and most of the warm water.
2. Bring together into a soft dough, adding the remaining water if needed. Knead for 5–8 minutes until smooth.
3. Place in an oiled bowl, cover and leave to rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled.
4. Knock back the dough and divide into 6 balls. Roll each into a small oval or circle.
5. Warm a dry frying pan over a medium heat. Cook each flatbread for 1–2 minutes per side until puffed and lightly charred in spots.
6. Mix a couple of tablespoons of olive oil with the za'atar and brush over the warm breads.
7. Top with crumbled feta, drizzle with honey and scatter with mint leaves.
